## 📝 Steps Performed

1. Opened the Chrome extensions page via `chrome://extensions`.
2. Reviewed each installed extension for:
   - Permissions used
   - Developer details
   - User reviews and ratings
3. Identified any suspicious or unused extensions.
4. Found **“Free VPN for Chrome – VPN Proxy”** suspicious due to:
   - High-risk permissions (read/change data on all websites)
   - Unknown publisher
   - Poor user feedback
5. Removed the suspicious extension using the **Remove** option.
6. Restarted the browser.
7. Checked performance using Chrome’s Task Manager and general responsiveness.
